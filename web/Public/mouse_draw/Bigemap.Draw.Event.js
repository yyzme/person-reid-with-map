/**
 * ### Events
 * Once you have successfully added the Leaflet.draw plugin to your map you will want to respond to the different
 * actions users can initiate. The following events will be triggered on the map:
 *
 * @class BM.Draw.Event
 * @aka Draw.Event
 *
 * Use `BM.Draw.Event.EVENTNAME` constants to ensure events are correct.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * map.on(BM.Draw.Event.CREATED; function (e) {
 *    var type = e.layerType,
 *        layer = e.layer;
 *
 *    if (type === 'marker') {
 *        // Do marker specific actions
 *    }
 *
 *    // Do whatever else you need to. (save to db; add to map etc)
 *    map.addLayer(layer);
 *});
 * ```

     *          layers.eachLayer(function (layer) {
